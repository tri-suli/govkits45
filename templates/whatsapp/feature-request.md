## Governance Notes

> - Only Product Owners are authorized to send messages related to Feature Requests
> - Acknowledgment message must be sent within 1 working day after the request is received
> - No implementation commitments should be submitted before the PO authorizes the roadmap
> - BA drafts clarification sessions, but communication to clients remains through PO
> - If the client request comes from a Phase 1 conversation (bug or data), the DM must create a new Tracking ID before the PO sends this acknowledgment
